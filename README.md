# Kobold Player Model Port 
Continuation of the Kobold Player Model Port for Vintage Story.

Kobolds, but for 1.20 (and beyond!)

Credits:
- Soi (Original Kobold Player Model mod)
- Caliber (1.20 port)
- Xeirla (a.k.a "Rur") (1.20+ cleanup)

-----

This repository is intended to serve as additional point of access to the Kobold Player Model Port, and its future updates past version 1.2.15

The files found in this repository have been altered significantly to better futureproof the mod for vanilla Vintage Story updates, better compatibility, and for ease of maintenence purposes. 

Notably, some additional documentation about the mod, a changelog, and other minor fixes and compatibility patches can be found included here. For those wishing to help contibute to the mod, but are unfamiliar with Vintage Story modding, these docs should hopefully provide some extra help getting started with this mod in particular. 

The source files for the Kobold model have been included as well, carried forward from the original Kobold Player Model mod by Soi, which was then ported to 1.19/1.20 by Caliber. 

# Installing
This is a client-side only mod (currently). Please install as you would any other mod via the official Vintage Story ModDB page found here:

Alternatively, the latest stable release of this repository can be found under Releases (to the right). Releases will only include copies of the main branch that have been tested to work without major issues or errors, and will have listed what game version they support. 

If you want the absolute newest version of changes, feel free to clone this repository and pack it into an .zip archive! From there the mod can be manually installed as normal, however it will not have as much testing done. 

# Documentation
Additional documentation about the mod can be found in the following files:
- CHANGELOG.md
- "kobold-comment" blocks found in modified JSON files

# Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the mod, please first read up on the basics of Vintage Story content mods before continuing! Guides for such can be found on the Vintage Story Wiki:

[[VS Wiki: Modding Basics Portal]](https://wiki.vintagestory.at/Modding:Modding_Basics_Portal)

It is also advised that if you intend to use official modding tools, to be aware that the JSON output generated may not be very clean. Some files in this mod were manually edited to be easier to read, parse with custom scripts, and in order to futureproof the mod better against base game updates. Please read the included documentation files before working with the mod, to see our recommendations for specific files that require extra consideration or some manual editing (most notably, changes that affect the `seraph-faceless.json` patch file)

# Licence

The project is liscenced under the terms of The Unlicence, which effectively submits the work into the public domain. This is consistent with the original Kobold Player Model license, and its port by Caliber thereafer. 

We kindly ask that any contributions to this repository and iteration of the mod are also made under the same terms!


# Special Thanks

Thank you to everyone who has played with or supported this mod since its creation. <3

Making this repository and trying to preserve the mod's maintainability is driven heavily by the enjoyment we all derive from it.
While I don't expect to maintain or update it actively for long, my hope is that the efforts here will make that work easier for the next person.
